# Pong-game
Classic Atari game
To run a game, copy the code into http://www.codeskulptor.org/ and hit Run. Google Chrome will be the preferred browser.

CodeSkulptor is a browser-based Python interpreter. It implements a subset of Python 2, plus the addition of three graphical libraries, SimpleGui, SimpleMap, and SimplePlot.

Basically, CodeSkulptor executes Python code on a web browser and also contains the simplegui module used to create the games.
